# snakemake_recipes

This is a github repo with different snakemake recipes setup for NCI computer structure.  
Head tip to Kevin Murray for getting me started on with snakemake on NCI.  

## Structure

Each folder contains all the recipies for a specific pipeline to run on NCI specificly.  
There are hardcoded bits there that need to be changed for different setups on different NCI accounts, projects, and such.
